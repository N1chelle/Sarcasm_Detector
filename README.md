# Sarcasm Detector

### The Goal

The project is aimed to build a neural network model to identify sarcasm in textual data.

### About the Dataset

Dataset from ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection) has been used for this project.
This News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection is collected from two news websites. ![*TheOnion*](https://www.theonion.com/) aims at producing sarcastic versions of current events and the ![authors](https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/) have collected all the headlines from News in Brief and News in Photos categories (which are sarcastic). They collected real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines from ![*HuffPost*](https://www.huffpost.com/).

Each record consists of three attributes:

* `is_sarcastic`: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0

* `headline`: the headline of the news article

* `article_link`: link to the original news article. Useful in collecting supplementary data
